// A helper function is a way to reduce complexity within other functions. 
// For example, if you had a computation that needed to be made frequently 
// within other functions, you might make a helper function which returns that 
// computation and embed that function wherever you need it. 
// Essentially, there is little difference between the structure of a 
// helper function and other functions, though they should be small and generic.
